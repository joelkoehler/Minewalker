# Project 5: Mine Walker

* Author: Joel Koehler
* Class: CS121 Section 2
* Semester: Spring 2018

## Overview

This project creates a GUI of a grid of buttons in a JFrame with a random walk, mines, and an 
objective to reach the destination point.

## Compiling and Using

To compile and run this program, open MineWalker.java, MineWalkerPanel.java, MineFieldPanel.java, 
and MineFieldButton.java in eclipse and run the driver class (MineWalker.java). The grid size text 
entry box can only be used if you click new game, this will create a new grid with your entered
grid size (an integer).

## Discussion

This project took a long time. The labs helped immensely. The hardest part of this project was 
debugging and fixing errors. I spend more time fixing issues than actually writing the program. 
The logic behind most of the methods was pretty straight forward, the most difficult part
was figuring out how to keep track of a current point. I first tried using another 2D array
but later opted for an x,y point called current. The MineFieldButton class was how I kept
track of all my button attributes. I found this class to be very useful through out the project.
This project was my introduction to JPanel content because I was sick with the flu for the week
that we covered it in lecture. Because of this, I felt like I was behind for the first week I 
spent working on it, but the labs helped me get my bearings.

## Testing

To test this project, I had a friend play it for a few minutes and try to break it. He found several
issues that I was able to fix. My program has a few minor issues with it still that I was unable to 
fix in the alloted time. These issues are buttons not being disabled when I win or lose. They do 
disable when I give up, and I'm using the exact same lines of code to do the disabling, it just doesn't 
work when it's placed in the GridListener.
